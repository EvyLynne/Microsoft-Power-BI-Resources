# SSMS-DB-Schema-Diagram
This is a Microsoft Power BI report used to visualize a database relationship schema. <br>
I needed to diagram the database for future work.  <br>
The development enviornment is SQL Server version SQL2022	RTM	Developer Edition (64-bit)	16.0.1050.5<br>

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16 <br>
and Microsoft Power BI. <br>

I used the Adventureworks databases as samples - I used both the Data Warehouse and the OLTP to demonstrate differnet schema visualizations.  <br>

I included the dimDate table to build some commonly used date methods and a Measures table for refrence. <br>

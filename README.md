The development enviornment is SQL Server version SQL2022	RTM	Developer Edition (64-bit)	16.0.1050.5

I used the Adventureworks databases as samples - I used both the Data Warehouse and the OLTP to demonstrate differnet schema visualizations.

I included the dimDate table to build some commonly used date methods and I will also add a measures table for reference.
All resource materials and links are included in the report on a page: "References".

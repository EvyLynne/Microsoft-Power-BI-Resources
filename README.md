# SSMS-DB-Schema-Diagram
This is a Microsoft Power BI report used to visualize a database relationship schema. 
This came up during a lag in a project.  I needed to diagram the database for future work.  
I edited the original using the Microsoft Adventureworks2019DW Database that I had previously loaded on my localmachine.

I included the dimDate table to build some commonly used date methods and I will also add a measures table for reference.
